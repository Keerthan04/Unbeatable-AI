# Unbeatable TicTacToe AI

## Project Overview

This project implements an unbeatable TicTacToe game using the Minimax algorithm. The AI opponent is designed to either win or force a draw in every game, making it impossible to defeat.

## Features

- Intuitive user interface for the TicTacToe game
- Unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Built with Next.js and React for optimal performance

## How It Works: The Minimax Algorithm

### What is Minimax?

Minimax is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player turn-based games like TicTacToe, Chess, and Connect Four. It helps determine the optimal move by examining all possible future moves and their outcomes.

### Core Concept

The algorithm works by recursively simulating all possible moves and their consequent game states:

- The AI assumes that you (the opponent) will play optimally
- The AI evaluates each possible move by looking ahead to the end of the game
- It assigns scores to each outcome:
  - Win for AI: +1 points
  - Draw: 0 points
  - Loss for AI: -1 points

### The Algorithm in Action

For TicTacToe, the process works as follows:

1. The AI considers all available moves on its turn
2. For each possible move, it simulates what would happen if it made that move
3. Then, it simulates all your possible responses
4. This continues recursively until reaching terminal game states (win, lose, draw)
5. The algorithm then "backs up" values from terminal states to determine the best move

### Why It's Unbeatable

In a game with perfect information like TicTacToe, if both players play optimally, the game always ends in a draw. The Minimax algorithm ensures the AI plays perfectly by:

- Always choosing winning moves when available
- Blocking your winning moves when necessary
- Setting up unavoidable winning scenarios when possible
- Forcing a draw when winning is not possible
